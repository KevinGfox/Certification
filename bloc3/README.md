This project goal is to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in Walmart stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help Walmartâ€™s marketing services understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

The project can be divided into three steps:

Part 1 : Make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning
Part 2 : Train a linear regression model (baseline)
Part 3 : Avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model
